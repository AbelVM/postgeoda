* Weights format

 * The binary format of spatial weights
 *
 * char (1 bytes): weights type: 'a'->GAL 'w'->GWT
 * uint32 (4 bytes): number of observations: N
 * ...
 * uint32 (4 bytes): index of i-th observation
 * uint16 (2 bytes): number of neighbors of i-th observation (nn)
 * uint32 (4 bytes x nn): neighbor id
 * float (4 bytes x nn): weights value of each neighbor
 * ...
 *
 * total size of GAL weights = 1 + 4 + (2 + nn *(4+4)) * N
 * total size of GWT weights = 1 + 4 + (2 + nn * 4) * N
 *
 * e.g. 10 million observations, on average, each observation has nn neighbors:
 * if nn=20, gal weights, total size = 0.76GB
 * if nn=20, gwt weights, total size = 1.5GB
 *
 * e.g. 100 million observations, on average, each observation has nn neighbors:
 * if nn=20, gal weights, total size = 7.6GB
 * if nn=20, gwt weights, total size = 15.08GB
